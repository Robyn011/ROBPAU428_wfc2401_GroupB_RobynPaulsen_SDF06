## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

In this project, I recreated a simplified version of an Instagram profile page focusing on CSS layout and styling. This involved applying various CSS techniques to achieve a responsive, aesthetically pleasing design that functions well across different devices.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I feel confident in using Flexbox and Grid to structure web page elements. Implementing these techniques to align and distribute content was a highlight of my learning.
- **Responsive Design**: I successfully implemented media queries to ensure the page looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style the profile image, user information, and gallery section effectively, closely resembling an Instagram profile.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: Adjusting layouts and font sizes for smaller screens was challenging. I had to experiment with different approaches to ensure the design remained consistent and functional.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: Implementing interactive elements like hover and focus effects required more practice and research to get them right.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I want to explore more advanced CSS properties and animations to enhance the user experience.
- **Code Optimization**: While my code achieved the desired outcome, I believe I can improve its efficiency and readability.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I adhered closely to the Instagram layout for practice but would like to experiment with more creative design choices in future projects.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was an invaluable hands-on experience in applying CSS layout techniques. It helped solidify my understanding of CSS and its practical applications in web development. I look forward to building on these skills in future projects.
